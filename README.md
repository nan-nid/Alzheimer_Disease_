Aim: Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Progression using Longitudinal Clinical and Neuroimaging Data.

Prerequisite Required: Machine learning, Deep learning, Programming languages(python tools and libraries).

Project Type: Research Paper

Objectives: To develop a machine learning model based model for classifying Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data, with the aim of aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.To classify the 7 different stages of Alzheimer’s disease using various machine learning techniques (like SVM, random forest).To examine the abnormalities in brain structure with the help of an MRI scan & detecting Alzheimer's disease in the early stages.

Conclusion: With the help of this project, we will be able to early detect AD and will be able to give treatment on the basis of the severity of the condition. With the help of early detection, a person might live a little longer than expected. Identify the most prescribed drugs for the patient suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in mild, moderate & severe cases. The proposed model should be effective, easy to deploy, time-saving & cost-efficient.
